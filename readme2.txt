One possible explanation is that you are writing the white paper, and soliciting feedback from the team. I respectfully suggest a different approach for you. Write a draft of the paper (does not have to be perfect), and present it to a small team first.
Also, I appreciate you waiting for me on Thursday. I dont quite understand why you decided to reschedule, I would say "please proceed discussing research ideas without me, so we keep the process going". I could not say it on Thursday (I wasn't able to speak), so I am saying it now.

This unhealth situation, unnecessary pressure and unrealistic expectations are very exhausting. I am respectfully inviting you to go back to productive collaboration we had for many years (with a long list of stellar achievements).

PP.SS. I was truly sorry to hear that your bonus has been below your expectations. If you could imagine my situation - zero bonus, no paid vacation/sick days, no paid holidays, no health insurance and no pension plan. On top of that, I unexpectedly had no "base salary equivalent" for 3 mo. It has been quite hard on my family. Did I tell you that both my sons have special needs, and have to attend a special school?
